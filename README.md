Hackathon project for ApScript
Team- Bit-Ends

A web app in which people can ask their queries either anonymously or using their profile name.
The queries can be answered by anyone either anonymously or using their profile name. The questions and answers can be liked or disliked.

The app will also support password authentication for users while signing up. They can then login and start using the app.

A valuation system based on “credits” will be used for ranking people.
For a particular number of likes on an answer, 1 credit will be awarded and increase the person’s reputation on website (if the question is not answered anonymously).

A section for “Projects” will be made for posting of a project and allowing others to contribute. A project could be anything like an essay, report etc. 

There will be domain specific channels or rooms including queries and projects belonging to that domain.
